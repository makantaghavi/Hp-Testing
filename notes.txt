Persist port values
Move global tick to MapNode for generators? Or just use global tick at Map Node level, not node def
Make all generators use global tick
Automatic Variadic Inputs
Graph 4/6-up (20x 6time series)
Variadic Graph nodes display time series for each input
Graph add Min, Max, Mean
Graph and Plot nodes inherit from a common PanelDisplayNode, enabling global display pausing (with visual indicator on each panel)
Pause individual PanelDisplayNodes?
Aggregate PanelDisplayNode, one panel that tiles multiple 
3-D Plot (trails; xyz and pitch,yaw,roll)
Node Editor: initfn, flags (variadic, generator, display?, emitter?), nodeState
Node Editor: Port Properties (type<enum>, default<type>, continuous<b>, address)
Layout Persistence and Selection
Close Panels on Node Deletion/Removal/Open
Refactor node defns with prototypal inheritance
Inheritable/shared nested ContainerMapNode definitions
jsPlumb 1.7.4 or Multiple Drag
Remove Panels on Node deleted
Panel Titles Update on Node Title Change
Enter to insert single node
Reload node list when a node or mapping is saved
Typed Port Editors

Debounce Node

Enum Port Type? String Port Type
Fix backspace on port editor

Blender
Cue List
Cue List UI

Nodes:
Average over time (Finite, Infinite)
Window Smooth, Infinite Smooth:
Decay (Finite, Infinite)
Display?
Hold
Invert
Negate
Random
Perlin
Stop Watch
Sample and Hold?
LFO, not just sine (Square, Sawtooth (up, down), Triangle)
Multiplex, Demultiplex
Span, Splay (Select; integer and floating point... select an output and pass an input value through; split up the input into a bunch of 0..1 ranges that span the whole input range (specify min, max, and number of outputs?)) Float Select interpolates over inputs... that's just Span, right?
Threshold?
ToSigned, ToUnsigned?
Integrate, Differentiate
Counter?
Segmenter (Value has to change by a certain threshold before the output changes)
RectToPolar, PolarToRect?
